# Intelligent Kiosk Sample
The Intelligent Kiosk Sample is a collection of demos showcasing workflows and experiences built on top of the Microsoft Cognitive Services. Most of the experiences are hands-free and autonomous, using the human faces in front of a web camera as the main form of input (thus the word "kiosk" in the name).

# Requirements
1. A Windows 10 computer (the sample is a UWP application)
2. A webcam, ideally top-mounted so you have a similar experience as looking at a mirror when interacting with the demos 
3. Visual Studio 2015
4. API Keys
  * You will need Face, Emotion, Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Bing Search and Bing AutoSuggestion API Keys. Visit  [Microsoft.com/cognitive](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) if you need keys. Please notice that some of the demos perform tasks in realtime, so if you are going to use some of those demos you will need to upgrade to a paid key so it has enough throughput and won't be throttled. 

# Running the sample
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2015 and hit F5
2. Enter your API Keys in the Settings page (they will be saved in the user profile). See [Settings](Documentation/AppSettings.md) for  more details on the available settings.
3. Explore one of the scenarios

# Source Code Structure

* Kiosk/ServiceHelpers: A portable library that serves as a wrapper around the several services. 
 * One of the key things that the wrappers provide is the ability to detect when the API calls return a call-rate-exceeded error and automatically retry the call (after some delay). 
 * The ImageAnalyzer class is another key class here, responsible for wrapping an image and exposing several methods and properties that act as a bridge to the Cognitive Services. 
 * Another example of functionality is the FaceListManager class, which is a wrapper on top of the FaceList APIs to make it easier to track unique faces. 

* Kiosk/Views: The root pages that represent the various views in the kiosk.

* Kiosk/Controls: The controls used by the various pages in the kiosk.
