## Inspiration

We conceived our small application by taking into consideration the desire of many people to develop their public speaking abilities and their need to gain an insight into how diverse audiences perceive them.

## What it does

The application prompts the user to upload a number of images from his own computer and using the Microsoft Cognitive Services, it provides a coefficient between 0 and 1 according to the intensity of the emotions displayed by people in pictures. It can offer the most valuable insight if the images all include the same audience at different moments in a presentation.

## How we built it

Using the online resources published by Microsoft (e.g. documentation and references of the Emotion API) and Visual Studio, we build a simple Windows Form Application, consisting of two forms, one of which contains the form for uploading images, while the other one displays the results.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we encountered was making the different pieces of the application fall into place. While one of us tried to build the UI, someone else explored how to make use of the Emotion API and the other one worked on converting the resulting JSON into a useful format for further processing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Taking into account our inexperience and the amount of time we spent researching online the abilities of the tools we planned to use, getting the application to work without crashing might be regarded as an accomplishment itself. Also, we would say that we worked quite well as a team, learned new things and enjoyed ourselves.

## What we learned

We now know how to make use of the Cognitive Services API, how to convert the JSON into the wanted form and how to integrate these pieces into an Windows Forms Application.

## What's next for Audience Analyzer
We will definitely try to enhance the user interface and offer a more in-depth analysis of the results given by the Emotion API and we are considering offering advice to our users as to how to hone their public speaking skills.
